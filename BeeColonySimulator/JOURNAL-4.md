## Week 1/2

### 22 March - 1st April

We started part one during the exercise session of last
week but didn't go far. We thus "completed" the code on 
friday of the same week. Unfortunately the code we had written
wasn't perfect, we had to correct some errors in order to
pass all test cases and assertions (this was done on Tuesday
of this week). Then between Wednesday and Thursday we managed to
complete part 2.1 and pass the graphical test. The only thing is 
that when we run the test the graphical window that appears,
and then shows the terrain, looks kind of small to me, and we can't
figure out whether it is a configuration problem or not.
The main reason we progressed slowly for the first part was because we
decided to use Clion as IDE and thus had to solve some issues with the file
organization and SFML library. But we managed, in the end, to sort them out.

## Weeks 11 & 12

### Sunday 15, May 2022

Week 11:
Last week, the first of the two allocated ones for the fifth part, we complete part 5.1 and made good progress on
5.2 which is close to completion. For now all seems to work properly. We started putting comments for all methods in the
`.hpp` files we were asked to write. We tried to use as much as possible the `const` qualifier in order to make sure
that no abnormal behaviour could be allowed. We are considering a full review of our code in order to find possible ways to improve
the program and hopefully increase its efficiency. Though our top priorities are finishing the 5th part, writing useful comments and, if time lets us,
work on part 6 and further extensions.

Week 12:
It's tuesday the 17th at 11:30 and yesterday part 5.2 was finished. This morning part 5.3 was brought to completion except for
the fact that when the Worker Bee arrives to the flower and starts collecting pollen, it doesn't seem to stop when the max pollen
level is attained to return home.
