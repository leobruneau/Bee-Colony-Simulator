## Weeks 11 & 12

### Sunday 15, May 2022

Week 11:
Last week, the first of the two allocated ones for the fifth part, we complete part 5.1 and made good progress on
5.2 which is close to completion. For now all seems to work properly. We started putting comments for all methods in the
`.hpp` files we were asked to write. We tried to use as much as possible the `const` qualifier in order to make sure 
that no abnormal behaviour could be allowed. We are considering a full review of our code in order to find possible ways to improve 
the program and hopefully increase its efficiency. Though our top priorities are finishing the 5th part, writing useful comments and, if time lets us, 
work on part 6 and further extensions.

Week 12:
It's tuesday the 17th at 11:30 and yesterday part 5.2 was finished. This morning part 5.3 was brought to completion except for
the fact that when the Worker Bee arrives to the flower and starts collecting pollen, it doesn't seem to stop when the max pollen
level is attained to return home.
