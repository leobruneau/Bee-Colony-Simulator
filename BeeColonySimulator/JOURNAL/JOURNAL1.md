#JOURNAL #1

## Week 1/2
###22 March - 1st April
We started part one during the exercise session of last
week but didn't go far. We thus "completed" the code on 
friday of the same week. Unfortunately the code we had written
wasn't perfect and se we had to correct some errors in order to
pass all test cases and assertions (this was done on Tuesday
of this week). Then between Wednesday and Thursday we managed to
complete part 2.1 and pass the graphical test. The only thing is 
that when we run the test the graphical window that appears,
and then shows the terrain, looks kind of small to me, and we can't
figure out whether it is a configuration problem or not.
